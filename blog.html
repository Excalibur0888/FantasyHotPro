            Fantasy basketball offers fans a unique way to engage with the
            sport, blending statistical analysis, strategy, and an understanding
            of the game. It’s not just about picking the most popular
            players—true success lies in carefully crafting a roster that
            balances star power, consistency, and potential upside.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            To build a competitive fantasy basketball team, start by
            understanding the scoring system of your league. Points, rebounds,
            assists, steals, and blocks are commonly rewarded, but turnovers may
            deduct points. Familiarize yourself with these rules and prioritize
            players who excel across multiple categories.

            Draft day is a pivotal moment in fantasy basketball. Research player
            rankings, consider injury histories, and stay informed about
            preseason performances. While superstars like Nikola Jokić or
            Giannis Antetokounmpo might be tempting first picks, don’t overlook
            mid-tier players who can deliver consistent value.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Once the season starts, your job as a fantasy manager is far from
            over. Monitor player performances and keep an eye on the waiver wire
            for emerging talent. Injuries, trades, and coaching changes can
            significantly impact a player’s value, so adaptability is key to
            staying ahead of the competition.

            Fantasy basketball also rewards those who think ahead. Anticipate
            trends in player usage, study matchups, and identify
            "sleepers"—under-the-radar players poised to have breakout seasons.
            Leverage advanced statistics like Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and
            Usage Rate to gain an edge.

            Whether you’re competing in a casual league with friends or a

            Football, or soccer as it’s known in some parts of the world, has a
            rich history dating back centuries. What began as a rudimentary game
            played on village greens has grown into a multi-billion-dollar
            global industry. Its evolution reflects changes in society,
            technology, and culture.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            The establishment of standardized rules by the Football Association
            in 1863 was a turning point for the sport. These regulations laid
            the groundwork for organized competitions, including the iconic FA
            Cup, which remains one of football’s most prestigious tournaments.

            Innovations like the introduction of professional leagues, televised
            matches, and advanced training techniques have further elevated the
            game. Today, clubs like Real Madrid, Manchester United, and
            Barcelona have become cultural symbols, boasting millions of fans
            worldwide.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Technological advancements such as VAR (Video Assistant Referee)
            have added a layer of precision to officiating, though not without
            controversy. These changes illustrate the sport’s constant drive for
            improvement while maintaining its core essence—a love for the
            beautiful game.

          <p class="modal__text">
            Football’s influence extends beyond the pitch. It unites
            communities, bridges cultural divides, and inspires millions.
            Whether it’s a local derby or the FIFA World Cup final, football
            continues to capture hearts and ignite passions like no other sport.

            Cricket, often called the gentleman's game, has a history that dates
            back centuries. Originating in England, it has grown into a sport
            loved by millions worldwide. From test matches that span five days
            to the high-octane T20 leagues, cricket continues to evolve while
            staying true to its roots.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            One of cricket's most fascinating aspects is its diversity of
            formats. Test cricket, with its emphasis on patience and strategy,
            is often considered the purest form of the game. In contrast, T20
            cricket offers fast-paced action and explosive performances that
            appeal to modern audiences.

            Another key factor in cricket’s enduring popularity is its ability
            to adapt. Innovations like the Decision Review System (DRS) and the
            introduction of colorful uniforms and night matches have made the
            game more engaging for fans. Franchise leagues like the IPL and Big
            Bash have also brought star players together, creating a global
            cricketing spectacle.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Cricket is more than just a sport—it’s a way of life for many.
            Whether it's the electrifying atmosphere of a packed stadium, the
            intricate strategies of captains, or the unforgettable moments
            created by legendary players, cricket has a unique charm that
            transcends borders and cultures.

          <img src="img/b3.jpg" alt="Marathon Running" class="modal__image">
          <p class="modal__text">
            Marathon running is one of the ultimate tests of human endurance and
            resilience. Covering 42.2 kilometers demands not only peak physical
            fitness but also immense mental fortitude. Let’s explore the science
            that underpins this remarkable feat.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Training for a marathon begins months in advance. Runners gradually
            increase their mileage to build endurance, focusing on both aerobic
            and anaerobic capacity. Long runs, speed work, and recovery days are
            all part of a carefully structured training plan.
          </p>
          <img src="img/b31.jpg" alt="Marathon Training" class="modal__image">
          <p class="modal__text">
            Nutrition plays a crucial role in marathon preparation. Carbohydrate
            loading before race day ensures glycogen stores are maximized,
            providing the energy needed to sustain prolonged activity. Hydration
            is equally critical, as even slight dehydration can significantly
            impair performance.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            During the race, the body undergoes significant stress. Heart rates
            increase, muscles endure repetitive strain, and energy reserves
            deplete. This is where mental strength comes into play. Runners
            often rely on visualization techniques and positive self-talk to
            push through the infamous "wall"—a point of extreme fatigue around
            the 30-kilometer mark.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Despite the challenges, completing a marathon is a life-changing
            achievement. It showcases the incredible capabilities of the human
            body and mind, inspiring runners and spectators alike. Whether
            you're aiming for a personal best or simply crossing the finish
            line, the marathon is a testament to the power of perseverance.

            variety of spins—topspin, backspin, and sidespin—to control the
            ball's trajectory and confuse their opponent. Mastering spin
            manipulation can turn a simple shot into a devastating weapon.

          <p class="modal__text">
            Another crucial aspect is placement. Instead of hitting the ball as
            hard as possible, skilled players aim for specific areas of the
            table to exploit their opponent’s weaknesses. This often involves
            targeting the corners, playing to the middle to disrupt footwork, or
            capitalizing on an opponent’s weaker side.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Mental endurance is also vital. Table tennis matches are fast and
            intense, requiring players to adapt quickly to their opponent’s
            tactics. Remaining calm under pressure and staying one step ahead
            can make the difference between victory and defeat.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Whether you're a casual player or aspiring champion, understanding
            the strategic depth of table tennis opens up new layers of
            appreciation for the sport. Next time you step to the table,
            remember—it’s not just about the speed; it’s about outsmarting your
            opponent.

            Ultimate Frisbee is a sport unlike any other. Combining the speed
            and skill of soccer with the agility of basketball, it offers a
            thrilling experience for players and spectators alike. But what
            truly sets Ultimate apart is its core principle: the "Spirit of the
            Game."
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Played without referees, Ultimate relies on players to
            self-officiate and maintain the integrity of the game. This emphasis
            on honesty, respect, and fair play creates a unique atmosphere where
            competition and camaraderie coexist.

            The game itself is a showcase of athleticism and strategy. Teams of
            seven players work together to pass the disc down the field and
            score in the opposing end zone. Precision throws, quick cuts, and
            spectacular diving catches are all part of the action.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Ultimate Frisbee is also remarkably inclusive. With mixed-gender
            teams and a welcoming community, it’s a sport where everyone can
            find their place. This inclusivity has contributed to its rapid
            growth, with leagues and tournaments popping up around the world.
          </p>
          <p class="modal__text">
            Whether you’re looking for a competitive challenge or a fun way to
            stay active, Ultimate Frisbee offers something for everyone. It’s
            more than just a sport—it’s a celebration of teamwork, respect, and
